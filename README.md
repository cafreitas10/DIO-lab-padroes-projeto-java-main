# Explorando Padrões de Projetos na Prática com Java

Repositório com as implementações dos padrões de projeto explorados no Lab "Explorando Padrões de Projetos na Prática com Java" na plataforma da Digital Innovation One.

Como incremento, eu adicionei o padrão Builder.

## Singleton

Use always only one instance of a class.

## Strategy

A navigator can behave like if it was on a road or on a public transport, that's different strategies.

## Facade

Why should your library users need to know all your internal classes and how to use them ?

With a Facade class, you can provide simpler ways of using your libray.

## Builder

Why should your library users need to know how to create the complex objects of your libray ?

With a Builder class, you can provide simpler ways of doing that.

Users only need to provide you the required data and your builder class will handle all objects instantiation and other things.
